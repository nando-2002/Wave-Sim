# Wave-Sim
This repo is a collection of programs that aim to solve the 2nd order wave equation in 1 and 2 dimensions. The 1D solver computes a domain with dirichlet boundaries (and a gaussian function as an initial condition). The 2D program contains both a pseudospectral solver that uses trigonometric basis functions, and a finite difference solver. All programs are using explicit time integration.
