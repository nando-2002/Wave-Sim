# Wave-Sim
This repo is a collection of programs that aim to solve the 2nd order wave equation in 1 and 2 dimensions. At the moment both the 1D and 2D solver are lower order explicit finite difference based, but will be updated to also implement higher order approximations, predictor-corrector methods and spectral methods.
